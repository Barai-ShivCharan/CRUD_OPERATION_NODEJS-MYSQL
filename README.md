# CRUD Operation API with Full Validation

This project is a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with full validation, developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MySQL**. The API allows you to perform basic CRUD operations and handles invalid data, such as incorrect IDs or missing fields, ensuring robust error management.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new entries to the database with validation on input data.
- **Read**: 
  - Retrieve all records from the database.
  - Retrieve a single record by its ID.
- **Update**: Update existing records using their ID.
- **Delete**: Delete records by ID.
- **Validation**: Full validation on input data, including proper error handling for invalid or non-existent records.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building the API.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing records.
- **Postman**: API testing tool for development and debugging.
- **HTML**: For any front-end rendering (optional).
- **VSCode**: IDE used for development.
